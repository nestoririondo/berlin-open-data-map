# Berlin Open Data Map

This project is a web application that displays a map of Berlin with markers for locations where items are being given away for free. The data is fetched from the [Verschenken statt Wegwerfen database](https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/verschenken-statt-wegwerfen) and the locations are geocoded using the Google Geocoding API.
